### embed.go

The `embed.go` file is a crucial component of **BYFA**. It is responsible for embedding shell files into Go code, enabling their usage during the build process. This allows **BYFA** to include essential scripts directly in the generated binary/executable file.

Please note that `embed.go` will not be built automatically when running `go build`. Instead, it is used during the `go generate` step to embed the shell files into the Go code.

For more information on how `embed.go` works, refer to the comments within the file.
